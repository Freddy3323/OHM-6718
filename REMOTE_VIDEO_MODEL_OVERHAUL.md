#### FAQ - COMPLETELY REWRITTEN

**Q: Does the builder come to the property?**
A: No. You attend the open home, and Matt joins you via video call. You film and show him around while he guides you on what to check.

**Q: What if I can't attend the open home?**
A: No problem! Send a friend, family member, or even your real estate agent with their phone. Matt guides them on what to film.

**Q: What if the agent doesn't allow filming?**
A: Most agents are fine with buyers filming for personal records. If there's an issue, discreetly explain you're consulting with a builder remotely. Or book a private inspection instead of open home.

**Q: Do I need good internet?**
A: Yes, mobile data or WiFi. FaceTime, Zoom, and WhatsApp all work. 4G is usually fine.

**Q: Can you see everything on video?**
A: We can assess anything you show us with your camera. But we can't see inside walls, roof spaces, or under floors—just like you can't.

**Q: Is this a full building inspection?**
A: No. This is a quick visual screening. Think of it as "builder's eyes for 30 minutes" to help you decide if a property is worth pursuing further.

**Q: Is this as good as a full inspection?**
A: No. This is a quick visual screening to help you decide if a property is worth pursuing further. For properties you're seriously considering, we recommend a full pre-purchase inspection.

**Q: When do I get the written summary?**
A: Premium tier only. Sent via email within 24 hours of your call.

**Q: Can I record the call myself?**
A: Yes! Or add the $49 recording add-on and we'll send you a professional copy.

**Q: How fast do I get feedback?**
A: Instant! During the video call. Premium tier includes written summary sent within 24 hours.

#### Legal Disclaimer - UPDATED

**Important: What This Service Is (And Isn't)**

OpenHomeMate is a remote visual assessment service. You film the property via your smartphone, and our licensed builder provides real-time expert opinion.

**Our Service Includes:**
- Live video call guidance (15-30 minutes)
- Visual assessment based on what you show us
- Verbal feedback in real-time
- General builder opinion from 25+ years experience
- Optional written summary (Premium)

**Our Service Does NOT Include:**
- Physical attendance at the property
- Use of tools or testing equipment
- Access to restricted areas (roofs, subfloors, wall cavities)
- Formal pre-purchase inspection reports
- Warranties or guarantees
- Compliance with AS 4349.1 standards

**Important Limitations:**
We can only assess what you show us on camera. We cannot see inside walls, under floors, or in roof spaces. Lighting and camera quality affect our assessment. This is NOT a substitute for a comprehensive building inspection.

**Recommendation:**
Use OpenHomeMate for quick property screening. For properties you're seriously considering purchasing, we recommend a full pre-purchase inspection with physical site access.

#### Testimonials - UPDATED

**Sarah, First Home Buyer:**
"I was at an open home and FaceTimed Matt. He spotted water damage under the sink I completely missed. Saved me $30k!"

**David, Interstate Investor:**
"I'm in Melbourne, property was in Sydney. My sister attended with her phone and Matt guided her through everything. Genius!"

**Emma, Busy Professional:**
"Matt told me 'that crack is cosmetic, don't stress.' Gave me confidence to make an offer. Best $129 I spent."
