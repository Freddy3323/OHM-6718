# OpenHomeMate - Before & After Comparison

## 🚨 CRITICAL CORRECTION COMPLETED

---

## THE FUNDAMENTAL MISTAKE (BEFORE)

### ❌ What The Website Said (WRONG):
```
"Matt attends the open home for you"
"Builder physically comes to the property"
"You don't need to be there - we attend for you"
"Matt will be at the open home with his phone"
"FaceTime call with Matt during his walkthrough"
```

### Problems:
- Implied builder travels to every property
- Suggested buyer doesn't need to attend
- Made service seem like full on-site inspection
- Confused about who films the property

---

## THE CORRECT MODEL (AFTER)

### ✅ What The Website Now Says (CORRECT):
```
"Your Builder In Your Pocket"
"You attend the open home with your smartphone"
"Matt joins you via video call and guides you remotely"
"You film, he watches, you get answers"
"Matt tells you where to point your phone"
```

### How It Actually Works:
1. **Buyer books online** ($79/$129/$199)
2. **Buyer attends open home** with smartphone
3. **Matt calls buyer** at scheduled time (FaceTime/Zoom/WhatsApp)
4. **Buyer films property** while walking through
5. **Matt watches video feed** from his office/home
6. **Matt guides buyer**: "Show me under that sink," "Pan to the ceiling"
7. **Matt gives instant feedback** during the call
8. **Premium tier**: Written summary emailed after

## KEY MESSAGING SHIFTS

### Old Tagline:
❌ "Your Builder at Every Open Home" (implies physical presence)

### New Tagline:
✅ "Your Builder In Your Pocket" (implies remote guidance)

---

### Old Positioning:

### New Positioning:
✅ "You attend, we guide via video"
✅ "Your builder, in your pocket"

## WHY THIS MATTERS

### The Previous Messaging Was:
1. **Confusing** - Unclear who attends, who films
2. **Misleading** - Suggested builder travels to every property
3. **Unrealistic** - Implied full on-site inspection capability
4. **Operationally Wrong** - Not how the service actually works

### The New Messaging Is:
1. **Crystal Clear** - Buyer attends with phone, builder guides remotely
2. **Accurate** - Reflects actual service delivery model
3. **Realistic** - Sets proper expectations (visual screening, not full inspection)
4. **Operationally Correct** - Matches how the service actually works
